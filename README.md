# TheShade
Mod for Slay the Spire.

(Early Alpha) New character, with 71 cards currently finished.

The Shade passively takes and deals more attack damage as the fight goes on. Instead of Defends, the Shade relies on Shadows to buy time.

This character has:
No defends
Many skills that can target anyone
A variety of unique utility cards whose value is not immediately apparent
A set of boss relics that grant bonus draw instead of energy
Curse synergy(TM)
A little Strike synergy(TM)
A multitude of cards that interact with debuffs and damage-over-time effects
Huge burst damage combos, set up over multiple turns

Mod also contains:
1 special event
1 custom potion

Balance is not guaranteed. Please feel free to leave me feedback in the comments. Tell me your favorite cards, card ideas you had while playing this character, or any issues you had while playing, even with other mods (I aim to keep this mod as compatible with other mods as possible.)
